Event Attendance Management System (EAMS)

Introduction

Welcome to the Event Attendance Management System (EAMS), an Android application developed as part of the EG2105 - Introduction to Software Engineering - Fall 2024 course. The primary goal of this project is to facilitate event registration and attendance tracking at a university.

EAMS is designed to provide an efficient and streamlined experience for event participants, event organizers, and administrators. The application supports three types of users: Attendees, Organizers, and Administrators.

Application Features

Attendee

An Attendee is a user who wishes to participate in events. Their functionality includes:

Registering an account (requires Administrator approval).

Searching for events based on keywords.

Requesting registration for an event.

Canceling an event registration.

Viewing the list of events they have requested to attend.

Organizer

An Organizer is responsible for managing events. Their functionality includes:

Registering an account (requires Administrator approval).

Creating and managing events.

Approving or rejecting registration requests from Attendees.

Viewing past and upcoming events.

Viewing a list of registered Attendees for their events.

Deleting events if necessary.

Administrator

The Administrator is a pre-registered user with the highest level of control. Their responsibilities include:

Approving or rejecting registration requests from Attendees and Organizers.

Viewing and managing registration requests.

Re-evaluating previously rejected registration requests.

Ensuring the system runs smoothly.
